# Linear Algebra Project

## Overview
This project consists of a set of Python scripts aimed at performing various linear algebra operations, including slicing arrays, calculating matrix shapes, transposing matrices, and more. The tasks demonstrate essential programming concepts in linear algebra using both lists and NumPy arrays.

## Tasks
1. **Slice Me Up**: Slice an array into specific segments without using loops or conditionals.
2. **Trim Me Down**: Extract the 3rd and 4th columns from a matrix without using loops or conditionals.
3. **Size Me Please**: Determine the shape of a matrix and return it as a list of integers.
4. **Flip Me Over**: Return the transpose of a 2D matrix.
5. **Line Up**: Add two arrays element-wise and return the result.
6. **Across The Planes**: Element-wise addition of two 2D matrices.
7. **Howdy Partner**: Concatenate two 1D arrays and return the new array.
8. **Gettin’ Cozy**: Concatenate two 2D matrices along a specified axis.
9. **Ridin’ Bareback**: Perform matrix multiplication of two matrices.
10. **Let The Butcher Slice It**: Extract specific rows and columns from a matrix.
11. **I’ll Use My Scale**: Calculate the shape of a NumPy array.
12. **The Western Exchange**: Transpose a NumPy array.
13. **Bracing The Elements**: Perform element-wise operations on two input arrays (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
14. **Cat's Got Your Tongue**: Concatenate two matrices along a specific axis.
15. **Saddle Up**: Perform matrix multiplication using NumPy.
